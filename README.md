# Reference: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

This repository is in reference to Chapter 2, End-to-End Machine Learning project. 

According to the author, the purpose of this chapter is to become familiarized with common tasks of Machine Learning.
This includes, retrieving data, analyze a given problem, analyze the data and gain insight, prepare and transform the data for Machine Learning algorithms, select a model and train it, fine-tune the model and finally present and maintain the solution.

The code in this repository is reproduced at best and slightly modified according to my study. It serves as a bookmark for future projects and as a reference to my Machine Learning portfolio.

Refer to the preface of the book if you want to reproduce this code for personal use.
